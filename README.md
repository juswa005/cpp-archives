## 🗂️ Project Categories

### 1. Freshman Year Projects
During my early college years, I focused on **fundamentals of programming**, including:
- Basic syntax and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays 

**Example Projects:**
- **Basic Calculator**
- **Atm Machine Simulation** 
- **Quiz Game**

### 2. Sophomore Year Projects
After mastering the basics, I started tackling **more advanced problems** involving:
- Algorithm design and optimization
- Linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees
- Sorting and searching algorithms

**Example Projects:**
- **Student Grade Management**
- **Stack/Queue** 
- **Sorting/Searching Tool**
